⛧°。 ⋆༺♱༻⋆。 °⛧ hello ⛧°。 ⋆༺♱༻⋆。 °⛧

⛧ Most likely, you found me on PonyTown. You'll see me sitting around as mostly Cosplay ponies, like (but not limited to) Jeff the Killer, Rob Zombie, Magnus Hammersmith, Penguin, etc...

⛧ I don't do much besides sit around alone, though that doesn't mean I'm not open to talking. I may be editting or creating, so shoot me a whisper for a gaurenteed response!

⛧ INTERACT if you like : Metalocalypse, Creepypasta, Horror, Homestuck, Dead By Daylight, Marvel/DC/Image/Etc Comics, Mortal Kombat, Overwatch, Apex Legends...

⛧ DNI if : You're a chronically online puritan. I'm not about to be walking on eggshells for you. Just don't be a weirdo.
